원문 초록 (Original Abstract) The management of patients with orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders is challenging. Recognizing the opportunity to advance patient care, in 2019 the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) convened representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet), patient advocacy groups, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and orofacial pain experts to identify specific steps to improve care for patients. In response, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) created the Special Committee on Temporomandibular Joint Care (SCTMJC) whose assignment was to develop contemporary evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders.</description></item><item><title>July 2025 AAOMS News and Announcements</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/july-2025-aaoms-news-and-announcements/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/july-2025-aaoms-news-and-announcements/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Many oral maxillofacial surgery (OMS) applicants ponder the possibility and timing of starting a family during their OMS residency. The length and intensity of clinical training required may deter otherwise qualified future surgeons from pursuing an OMS residency. Whether it is the thought of performing a twelve-hour surgery while one’s child is taking their first steps or having to delay residency completion due to leave, residents inherently worry about sacrifices they will make or must make as a result of starting a family.</description></item><item><title>RE: “Coronectomy in Lower Third Molar Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis”</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/re-coronectomy-in-lower-third-molar-surgery-a-sys/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/re-coronectomy-in-lower-third-molar-surgery-a-sys/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Wellness initiatives in surgical residency training have become popular over the past few years. The high physical and intellectual demand intertwined with long working hours and performance anxiety has been linked to resident burnout, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization.1 Although such conditions have been historically neglected in certain settings, a recent paradigm shift has focused on mitigating such negative effects. In an attempt to combat these effects, institutional and departmental wellness initiatives have been developed and implemented globally.</description></item><item><title>The Use of Clear Aligners for Orthognathic Surgery: A Systematic Review</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/the-use-of-clear-aligners-for-orthognathic-surgery/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/the-use-of-clear-aligners-for-orthognathic-surgery/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) In 2002, I made the difficult decision to relocate from the United Kingdom to the United States to complete my oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) training. I had worked in the United Kingdom as a junior OMS trainee for several years in large district hospitals, where the medical or surgical director was an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and where OMS was 1 of the 9 surgical specialties. Having a dental degree put us at the top of the proverbial surgery food chain. At the time of my move, I was stupidly naïve to the complexity of the US OMS training system, the dental and medical licensure processes, and how different it was from the British model.</description></item><item><title>A Half-Century Review of Male and Female Resident Outcomes in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: A Single-Institution Report</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/a-half-century-review-of-male-and-female-resident-/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/a-half-century-review-of-male-and-female-resident-/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Preprosthetic surgery has been an integral part of the oral and maxillofacial surgeon’s practice since first described by Obwegeser in the 1970s. Since then, minimal changes or advancements in techniques have been described and are still taught in dental schools.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumors (D-TGCT) represent a rare group of benign proliferative lesions originating from the synovium of joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths, with infrequent involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Among these, chondroid D-TGCT, previously known as pigmented villonodular synovitis with chondroid metaplasia, constitutes an even rarer subtype displaying a specific affinity for the TMJ. Despite its distinctive nature, only a limited number of cases (n = 30) of chondroid D-TGCT have been extensively documented in existing literature.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Occlusion Using Conventional Versus Virtual Model Surgery in Segmental Maxillary Orthognathic Surgery Using the American Board of Orthodontics Discrepancy Index</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/comparison-of-occlusion-using-conventional-versus-/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/comparison-of-occlusion-using-conventional-versus-/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Maxillary segmentation is essential for achieving optimal occlusion in some cases by correcting transverse discrepancies, Bolton’s discrepancy, arch deformities, and alveolar angulation. Although traditional plaster model techniques are time-consuming and error-prone, many surgeons continue using them to set occlusion in segmental maxillary surgery despite the superior precision and outcomes of virtual surgical planning.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), also known as pigmented villonodular synovitis, is a benign yet locally aggressive lesion that primarily affects synovial tissue. Although relatively uncommon in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), TGCT’s of the TMJ are often locally aggressive and destructive in nature. TGCT is more commonly found in major long bones and joints. Its occurrence in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is relatively rare but can lead to significant clinical challenges due to its destructive nature.</description></item><item><title>DOES THE HYALURONIC ACID DOSAGE DURING ARTHROCENTESIS INFLUENCE PAIN REDUCTION AND MAXIMAL INCISAL OPENING?</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/does-the-hyaluronic-acid-dosage-during-arthrocente/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/does-the-hyaluronic-acid-dosage-during-arthrocente/index.html</guid><description>AI 리뷰 생성 실패 오류: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

원문 초록 (Original Abstract) Orbital fractures are surgically demanding due to their complex anatomy and aesthetic implications. This technical innovation describes a low-cost approach using open-source software (3D Slicer and Meshmixer) to design and print templates for preoperative molding of titanium meshes in orbital reconstruction. By segmenting the defect and printing only the affected orbital region, this technique reduces time, cost, and material usage while improving fit and efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of the radiological results between local and coronal incisions in the treatment of zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures</title><link>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/evaluation-of-the-radiological-results-between-loc/index.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:57:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurette683.github.io/joms/20250703/evaluation-of-the-radiological-results-between-loc/index.html</guid><description>핵심 요약 관골악궁 골절의 치료는 국소 절개와 관상 절개 두 가지 접근법이 주로 사용되며, 각각 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 본 초록은 이 두 가지 접근법의 차이점을 비교 분석하는 연구의 서론 부분으로 보이며, 구체적인 결과는 제시되어 있지 않습니다. 따라서 어떤 접근법이 더 효과적인지에 대한 결론은 제시되지 않았습니다.
