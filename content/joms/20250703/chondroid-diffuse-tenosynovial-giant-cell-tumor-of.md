#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumors (D-TGCT) represent a rare group of benign proliferative lesions originating from the synovium of joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths, with infrequent involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Among these, chondroid D-TGCT, previously known as pigmented villonodular synovitis with chondroid metaplasia, constitutes an even rarer subtype displaying a specific affinity for the TMJ. Despite its distinctive nature, only a limited number of cases (n = 30) of chondroid D-TGCT have been extensively documented in existing literature.
