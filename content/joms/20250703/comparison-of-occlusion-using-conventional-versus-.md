#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Maxillary segmentation is essential for achieving optimal occlusion in some cases by correcting transverse discrepancies, Bolton's discrepancy, arch deformities, and alveolar angulation. Although traditional plaster model techniques are time-consuming and error-prone, many surgeons continue using them to set occlusion in segmental maxillary surgery despite the superior precision and outcomes of virtual surgical planning. Limited research has directly compared the clinical utility of virtual surgical planning–based segmentation versus traditional model surgery.
