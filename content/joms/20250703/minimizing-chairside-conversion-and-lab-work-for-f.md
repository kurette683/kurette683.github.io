#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
The technique described herein uses a single wand that includes both intraoral scanning and intraoral photogrammetry to accurately capture abutment positions as well as soft tissue. This method minimizes the risk of malalignment because the abutment and soft tissue images are combined within one platform. At surgery, implants and multiunit abutments are placed and the abutments are scanned with an intraoral photogrammetry wand. These files are uploaded to the lab technician merges the files with a preoperative digital plan.
