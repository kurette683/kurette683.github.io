#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
The incidence of difficult airway is higher in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) operations than those in general surgery. Current predictors, including clinical tools like the LEMON (Look Externally, Evaluate Mallampati Classification, Obstruction, Neck Mobility, Motion of Jaw) score, are often inaccurate, leading to underdiagnosis and increased risks to patient safety.
