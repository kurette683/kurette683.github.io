#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
The management of patients with orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders is challenging. Recognizing the opportunity to advance patient care, in 2019 the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) convened representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet), patient advocacy groups, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and orofacial pain experts to identify specific steps to improve care for patients. In response, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) created the Special Committee on Temporomandibular Joint Care (SCTMJC) whose assignment was to develop contemporary evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders.
