#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Preprosthetic surgery has been an integral part of the oral and maxillofacial surgeon’s practice since first described by Obwegeser in the 1970s. Since then, minimal changes or advancements in techniques have been described and are still taught in dental schools. Recent advancements in research now highlight areas of greatest force on alveolar bone during mastication. With this knowledge, surgical planning can improve, helping to avoid buccal bone fractures and other complications that reduce the patient’s ability to wear a prosthesis.
