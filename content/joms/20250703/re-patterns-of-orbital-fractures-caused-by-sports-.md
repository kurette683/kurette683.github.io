#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
We read with great interest the recent publication by Xu and Abramowicz, "Patterns of Orbital Fractures Caused by Sports Injuries in Children," which provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of pediatric orbital trauma resulting from sports activities.1 We would like to commend the authors for addressing this pertinent topic, which has significant implications for public health and injury prevention in the pediatric population.
