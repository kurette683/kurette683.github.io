#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Orbital fractures are surgically demanding due to their complex anatomy and aesthetic implications. This technical innovation describes a low-cost approach using open-source software (3D Slicer and Meshmixer) to design and print templates for preoperative molding of titanium meshes in orbital reconstruction. By segmenting the defect and printing only the affected orbital region, this technique reduces time, cost, and material usage while improving fit and efficiency.
