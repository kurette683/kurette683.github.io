#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
This study introduces the shield-like septal extension graft technique, a novel approach for enhancing tip support, rotation, and projection in revision rhinoplasty cases. The shield-like septal extension graft is positioned in front of the caudal septum, mimicking a shield graft to provide structural reinforcement. The study included 18 patients (12 women and 6 men) with a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range: 9 to 15 months). No significant complications were observed, and patients achieved satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcomes.
