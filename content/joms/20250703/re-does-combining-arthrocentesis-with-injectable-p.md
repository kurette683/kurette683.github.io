#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
We read with great interest the manuscript by Chaulagain et al,1 which investigated the use of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) for the treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. This study is a valuable contribution to the field, as it expands knowledge on the potential therapeutic effects of blood-derived biomaterials in TMJ management.
