#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
In 2002, I made the difficult decision to relocate from the United Kingdom to the United States to complete my oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) training. I had worked in the United Kingdom as a junior OMS trainee for several years in large district hospitals, where the medical or surgical director was an oral and maxillofacial surgeon and where OMS was 1 of the 9 surgical specialties. Having a dental degree put us at the top of the proverbial surgery food chain. At the time of my move, I was stupidly naïve to the complexity of the US OMS training system, the dental and medical licensure processes, and how different it was from the British model.
