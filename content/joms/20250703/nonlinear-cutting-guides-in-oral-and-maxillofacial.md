#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Preservation of bone and anatomic structures during oral and maxillofacial resections are common goals of using custom cutting guides. Nonlinear cutting guides may offer improved patient care over linear cutting guides by allowing for additional areas of fixation, additional support for bony reconstructions, expanded use of nonvascular reconstructions, improved identification and preservation of anatomy, and improved cosmesis. A retrospective case series of 7 patients was created through a chart review of all patients undergoing resections at Augusta University between July 1, 2020, and January 31, 2025, for the purpose of identifying any close or positive margins on final pathology.
