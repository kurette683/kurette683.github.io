#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
This case series reports short- and medium-term outcomes for patients with intra-articular pain and dysfunction who, after failing nonsurgical and minimally invasive treatments, underwent arthrotomy, discectomy, and reconstruction with cryopreserved viable osteochondral allografts wrapped in viable cryopreserved umbilical cord tissue. Inclusion criteria required failure of nonsurgical treatments and arthrocentesis or arthroscopy, placement of an interpositional allograft postdiscectomy, preoperative and postoperative pain scores, and maximum interincisal opening measurements, and at least 12 months follow-up or until treatment failure.
