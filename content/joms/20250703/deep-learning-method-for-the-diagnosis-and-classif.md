#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Blowout fractures (BOFs) are common injuries. Accurate and rapid diagnosis based on computed tomography (CT) is important for proper management. Deep-learning techniques can contribute to accelerating the diagnostic process and supporting timely and accurate management, particularly in environments with limited medical resources.
