#### 원문 초록 (Original Abstract)
Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), also known as pigmented villonodular synovitis, is a benign yet locally aggressive lesion that primarily affects synovial tissue. Although relatively uncommon in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), TGCT’s of the TMJ are often locally aggressive and destructive in nature. TGCT is more commonly found in major long bones and joints. Its occurrence in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is relatively rare but can lead to significant clinical challenges due to its destructive nature.
